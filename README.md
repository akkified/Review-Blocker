# Review-Blocker

This is my **Chrome Extension** on blocking ***fake reviews*** on the internet. We use ***AI*** in this project to detect fake reviews, which are a common issue in many e-commerce sites nowadays. This can be beneficial, as it filters out reviews which could add bias in the purchase of an item. It could save you money, as well as effort.
